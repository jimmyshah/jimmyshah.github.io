I'm a Senior Data Engineer at [Warby Parker](https://www.warbyparker.com). I also volunteer with [Codebar](https://www.codebar.io), and have been invited to speak about diversity,inclusion and data literacy within the tech industry.

Occasionally, I serve in startup advisory roles and accept freelance work. Recently, I've led the data initiative at [The Landing](https://thelanding.app). In the past, I've also worked with [For Days](https://fordays.com) and advised [The Generalist](https://www.readthegeneralist.com).

Previously, I was a Data Scientist at [Cargo](https://drivecargo.com) and [MarketerHire](https://marketerhire.com). I graduated from [Swarthmore College](https://www.swarthmore.edu), studying both CS and Physics. During my time there, I conducted Statistical Physics [research](https://github.com/jimmyshah/website_links/tree/master/research_assets) on Pedestrian Dynamics.
