I'm a Data Scientist at [MarketerHire](https://marketerhire.com), a marketplace platform connecting high growth companies to vetted freelancers. I also volunteer with [Codebar](https://www.codebar.io), and have been invited to speak about diversity and inclusion within the tech industry.

Occasionally, I serve in startup advisory roles and accept freelance work. Recently, I've been involved with [The Generalist](https://www.readthegeneralist.com) and have led the data initiative at [ForDays](https://www.fordays.com).

Previously, I was the first Data Scientist at [Cargo](drivecargo.com). I graduated from [Swarthmore College](https://www.swarthmore.edu), studying both CS and Physics. During my time there, I conducted Statistical Physics [research](https://github.com/jimmyshah/website_links/tree/master/research_assets) on Pedestrian Dynamics.
