I'm a Data Scientist at [MarketerHire](https://marketerhire.com), a marketplace platform connecting high-growth brands with vetted freelancers. I also volunteer with [Codebar](https://www.codebar.io), and have been invited to speak about diversity and inclusion within the tech industry.

Occasionally, I serve in startup advisory roles and accept freelance work. Recently, I've been involved with [The Generalist](https://www.readthegeneralist.com) and have led the data initiative at [ForDays](https://www.fordays.com).

Previously, I was the first Data Scientist at [Cargo](drivecargo.com). I graduated from [Swarthmore College](https://www.swarthmore.edu), where I studied CS and Physics. During my time there, I conducted Statistical Physics [research](https://github.com/jimmyshah/website_links/tree/master/research_assets) on Pedestrian Dynamics.

Some of my other past experiences include [Sisense](https://www.sisense.com), [Contently](https://contently.com), [University of Washington Applied Physics Laboratory](http://www.apl.uw.edu), [National Institute of Standards and Technology](https://www.nist.gov), and [Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics](https://www.cfa.harvard.edu).
